======== # Luxury Rentals 🚗 ========

Luxury Rentals is a modern and responsive front-end landing page
for a car rental website. It showcases supercars and other vehicles,
allowing users to view detailed car specifications.

> **Note:** The "Book a car" functionality is not operational.
> This project is a front-end prototype only. To make it fully functional,
> a database and back-end integration would be required. 
> If anyone is interested in collaborating to add a database, 
> feel free to contact me at **dkozhani88@gmail.com**.

## ⚙️ Features

- Responsive hero section with video and overlay effects
- Interactive car details pages for each vehicle
- Car specifications displayed dynamically
- Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Stylish car cards using Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the website
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Interactivity and dynamic content
- **Bootstrap 5** – Layout, grid system, and responsive design
- **Font Awesome** – Icons for specifications and buttons

## ❗ Additional Notes

- Bootstrap was used to minimize custom CSS code and streamline responsive design.
- This project is a **front-end prototype**, and no actual bookings can be made.
- Perfect for showcasing skills in modern web development techniques.

## 🔐 Login / Signup

The website includes a **Login** and **Signup** section accessible via the "Account" menu.  

> **Note:** These features are not functional yet.  
> Currently, there is no back-end or database connected, so users cannot create accounts or log in.  

These sections are **planned for the future**, when I add back-end functionality 
and database integration. Once connected, users will be able to register, log in, 
and manage their bookings.  

This shows foresight in planning the project structure for a complete full-stack application.
